# .NET Core CI Pipeline
# This pipeline automates building and testing a .NET project.
# It performs the following:
# 1. Checkout the latest code from the repository.
# 2. Setup the .NET SDK environment.
# 3. Install dependencies via `dotnet restore`.
# 4. Build the project in Release mode using `dotnet build`.
# 5. Run tests and generate a JUnit report via `dotnet test`.
# 6. Upload test results as an artifact to the pipeline.
